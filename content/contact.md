You can find me on [github](https://github.com/Dev-chris21), [dev.to](https://dev.to/dev-chris21/), [discord](https://discord.gg/tjkdhHKU/) or [send me an email](mailto:chrispinmm001@gmail.com).

If you find the time to email me, i can only show my appreciation by replying. I might take some time cause i will be out for a while but i assure you i will be back and i will reply, i will continue updating this website. I like suprises and the unpredictability of connecting with someone new threw my site is something i look foward to.

As you have noticed this site is pretty fast, AD-free and spam free. I hope to continue posting new content, sharing my insights on new thoughts, new ways of navigating our uncertain world. You can help me continue making content threw your support here, [Buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/chrispinmmd/).
