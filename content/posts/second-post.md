People often consume various substances for a multitude of reasons. In our modern world, alcohol, cigarettes, weed, and drugs are among the most sought-after and commonly used substances.

To begin, it's important to acknowledge that these substances have well-documented negative physical and psychological effects. However, let's shift our focus to the perceived positives, or rather, the alleged benefits associated with using these substances. Many claim that they provide stress relief, confidence, happiness, and more. My perspective is that substances do not truly offer these benefits; rather, the perceived positives stem from a propaganda campaign aimed at ensuring a constant customer base for those profiting from these substances. In simple terms, your body doesn't require any external substances to function optimally.

Now, let's delve into the connection between substance use and productivity or discipline. It's a widely recognized fact that achieving anything or reaching a specific goal involves incremental progress rather than sudden leaps. Success demands patience and discipline, much like the gradual heating of water to reach its boiling point. This process represents long-term gratification. Conversely, indulging in substances fosters a craving for instant gratification. The desire for that immediate sense of relaxation or euphoria can lead to impatience. Robert Greene, in his book "Mastery," suggests that it takes roughly 10,000 hours of study and practice to master a new skill. If substance use instills a habit of seeking instant gratification, which it invariably does, one may lack the patience to endure the 10,000 hours required for mastery.

Therefore, despite the advertisements and the allure of substances that exist, if you aspire to excel or become a master in any field, you must avoid adopting the habit of instant gratification. The initial step toward achieving this is by either avoiding or controlling your consumption of substances.
