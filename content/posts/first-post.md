It is natural for a person to want to acquire a new skill, grasp a theory, or understand a formula for various reasons, such as obtaining a job, earning a degree, or simply out of curiosity. People employ various methods to assimilate new information.

The most common approach is to follow mainstream advice, read what others are saying, and essentially do what everyone else is doing. However, there is a significant issue with this approach. It focuses on the surface appearance of things, the way they seem from the outside. Unfortunately, appearances often diverge from reality. While accepting appearances might be acceptable in some contexts, when it comes to learning and gaining knowledge, it can be perilous. It predisposes you to misinformation, which can be even worse than ignorance.

My suggestion is to dig a little deeper. Peel back as many layers as you can until you truly understand how deep the rabbit hole goes. Seek out reliable and reputable sources of information to gain a comprehensive understanding of the subject. Don't settle for surface-level knowledge. As you venture further down the rabbit hole, you'll illuminate previously unexplored facets of your chosen field. With each twist and turn in this intellectual maze, you'll carve out your own small frontiers of knowledge. You'll find yourself in a position where you not only learn but also have the capacity to influence and shape your area of expertise.

This approach of delving deeper, of peeling back as many layers as possible, is not confined to any specific field. The world is in a constant state of change,

Whether you're an engineer, developer, scientist, marketing officer, or in any other profession, you stand to benefit from exploring how deep the rabbit hole goes in your field. Consequently, you'll be less susceptible to ignorance or, worse yet, misinformation.
